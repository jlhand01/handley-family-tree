        <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>John D. Handley</p><p>Life Story of John Daniel Handley</p><p>Born August 30, 1954</p><p>Early Life</p><p>I was the first Handley to be born in a hospital. I am the fourth child from the bottom—it’s too hard to count from the top.</p><p>From a young age, I loved helping Daddy work, so the family nicknamed me Cutter. At the age of seven, I was outside helping Daddy cut wood for the heater. When I went inside to warm up, I stood too close to the heater, and the flame jumped on me. I began to run, and that was the last time my brother Joshua was able to catch me. I was severely burned on my left leg and could not return to school that year, so I was retained in the first grade.</p><p>I can still remember seeing my brother David for the first time when he came home from the Marine Corps. That same year, we had the best crop.</p><p>Moving to Pine Bluff</p><p>Our family later moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas. What intrigued me most was that we had a telephone and a toilet that would flush. I also remember having two beds in each room, with three people sleeping in each bed.</p><p>Momma and Daddy even took in one more person—Bob Ware—who lived with us until he finished college.</p><p>First Jobs</p><p>At the age of fourteen, I started my first job at Jefferson Regional Medical Center, making $1.75 an hour. At that time, you had to be sixteen to receive a Social Security card, so the hospital kindly put my hours on Daddy’s check. When I turned fifteen, the law changed, and I began receiving my check in my own name.</p><p>I gave my parents everything except $25. I worked at JRMC until I was eighteen years old. At that time, while still a junior in high school, I began working at Standard Brake Shoes—school during the day and work in the evenings from 3–11 p.m. I worked there for two years.</p><p>In 1976, I began working at International Paper Mill. Thirty-eight years later, I am still there.</p><p>Family Life</p><p>At the age of seventeen, I met my wife, Brenda. I married her two days after her high school graduation. To this union, we had three daughters: Taneisha, LaShunda, and Jerricka Rose, and were later blessed with two beautiful granddaughters.</p><p>Faith and Service</p><p>I was baptized at an early age and was a member of Union Hopewell Baptist Church. In 2000, I joined Mt. Harmony Missionary Baptist Church.</p><p>I was ordained as a Deacon on August 3, 2014. I also serve as Sunday School Superintendent and as a member of the choir.</p><p>Work Ethic and Legacy</p><p>Now you can see why they nicknamed me Cutter. I have worked for forty-six years and have only been laid off once, for nine months.</p><p>If God continues to bless me with health and strength, I will continue to work and serve. This is my story, this is my praise.</p><p>To God I give all the glory for blessing me with my family—the Handley family.</p></section>
