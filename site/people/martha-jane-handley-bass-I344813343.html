                <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>Martha Jane Handley Bass</p><p>Life Story of Martha Jane Handley Bass</p><p>Early Life</p><p>Martha Jane Handley Bass was a beautiful woman who cared deeply for everyone she met—and in return, they loved her. She grew up with a giving heart, often putting the needs of others before her own.</p><p>She left school in the 9th grade to help her parents around the house, a reflection of her selfless character and dedication to family.</p><p>Marriage and Family</p><p>On October 21, 1961, Martha married her beloved husband. To this union, six children were born.</p><p>Before her marriage, she was blessed with two children: Maple Jean and James Kaiser.</p><p>Together, she and her husband created a large and loving family. Martha also became a mother to eight stepchildren and many grandchildren. Yet, she never called them stepchildren—she always said, “They are my kids,” and she never made a difference between them.</p><p>A Nurturing Spirit</p><p>Martha Jane was known for her generosity. She would feed anyone who came to her table, and she always found a way to provide for her family.</p><p>She not only helped raise her own children but also played a big role in raising her brothers. Her love and devotion extended far beyond her immediate household, reaching everyone around her.</p><p>Faith and Legacy</p><p>Martha Jane loved the Lord and lived her life guided by faith. She was a wonderful mother, grandmother, and sister. Everyone who knew her affectionately called her “Mot.”</p><p>Her family and community loved her dearly, and though she is missed, her spirit continues to inspire us all.</p></section>
