            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Alex Handley was born about 1892 in Louisiana. Records from the Selective Service and the 1930 census show him leading his household after relocating to Jefferson County, Arkansas.</p>
            <p>He married Jester Ann Pegross, who was born in February 1891 in Louisiana, and together they raised their family in the Tillar community of Desha County. Their home included children Alex Jr., Jimmie, David, Mollie, Joshua, and Leola, each of whom carried the Handley name into the next generation.</p>
            <p>Alex died on 5 April 1959 in Little Rock, Arkansas, while Jester Ann lived until March 1977 in Tillar. Their story anchors the Handley family&rsquo;s transition from Louisiana roots to a lasting presence in Arkansas.</p>
