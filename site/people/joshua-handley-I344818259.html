        <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>Joshua Handley</p><p>Life Story of Joshua Handley</p><p>Early Life</p><p>I was the tenth child out of sixteen children and was born at home in Tillar, Arkansas, with Sweet Ola James serving as the midwife.</p><p>I was given the nickname “Juice” because I loved to drink sorghum. There were times when I stayed home to work the fields, because there was no one else to do it and Daddy made us.</p><p>Growing up, I did not have a love for school until the seventh grade. Holidays were always plentiful in food, though not many gifts.</p><p>Moving to Pine Bluff</p><p>On February 17, 1967, our family moved to Pine Bluff in a big old red truck. We lived in a three-bedroom home, with two to three children sharing a bed. Despite those conditions, we were grateful for what we had—and in fact, we were very happy.</p><p>Education</p><p>I graduated number two in my class of more than 100 students at Coleman High School.</p><p>I attended AM&amp;N College (which became the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff in 1972) from 1970 to 1974, earning a B.A. degree in Mathematics.</p><p>Later, I pursued graduate studies and obtained a Master’s degree in Education from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.</p><p>Career in Education</p><p>I began my teaching career in the fall of 1974, teaching 7th through 12th grade mathematics in Altheimer, Arkansas.</p><p>After my first year of teaching, I underwent open brain surgery in the summer of 1975.</p><p>I continued to serve in education and retired from teaching in the Pine Bluff School District in 2010.</p><p>Later Years</p><p>Now retired, I am enjoying life and giving thanks to God for each day He blesses me with.</p></section>
