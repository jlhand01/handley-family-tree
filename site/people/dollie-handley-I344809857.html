        <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>Life Story of Dollie Handley</p><p>A Loving Spirit</p><p>A Tribute by Grand Niece, Tamika Bass Kentle</p><p>Aunt Dollie was a sweet and caring person who loved everyone who crossed her path. Her pride and joy was her Mot!She especially loved being around her sisters and brothers.</p><p>She enjoyed chewing gum, reading books, and most of all, reading the Bible. I had the joy and honor of living with her at my Grandma Martha’s house. Every morning, she would wake up to see us off to school, and every afternoon she would be on the porch, waving and smiling, happy to see us come home.</p><p>Aunt Dollie lived with Grandma Mot and Grandpa El until the Lord called her home. She left behind so many memories. She was my “roomy” in Tillar, and I will always cherish those days.</p><p>My Reflections</p><p>By Sister-in-law, Rosa C. Handley</p><p>As I reflect on the life of Dollie Handley, my memories go back to 1972. That was the year I met her, after marrying her second-oldest brother, David Handley, Jr. I immediately liked her.</p><p>Dollie and I shared something special—we were both July babies, hers on July 1st and mine on July 14th.</p><p>Dollie was truly one of a kind. In today’s world, she might be medically considered “developmentally challenged,” but I always rejected that label. I told my husband many times that Dollie had more sense than the rest of them combined.And she did!</p><p>If you ever wanted to reach anyone in the Handley family, Dollie was the one to ask. She either had every number committed to memory or had it written in her favorite spot on Mrs. Handley’s wall.</p><p>Dollie loved caring for the babies, including my two sons, Don and Lil Dave. She relished that role. She also had the funniest quotes. I’ll never forget her saying that “DonDon was the blatanest baby she had ever seen.” I didn’t even know what “blating” meant until she explained—“that boy just cries all the time.”</p><p>Another favorite memory of mine is watching her make a jelly sandwich. She must have put two inches of jelly between those slices of bread, and when I pointed it out, she just smiled and said, “But Rose, it eat good.”</p><p>You had to love Dollie—because she was pure love herself. We all did, and we miss her dearly.</p></section>
