Handley</p><p>Born February 10, 1946</p><p>Early Life</p><p>I was born on February 10, 1946, in Tillar, Arkansas, to David Handley Sr. and Verna Mae Rucker Handley. I am the eighth of sixteen children and the fifth of twelve boys.</p><p>Our family income was below the poverty line, and I was seriously educationally deprived. Because of working on the farm, I rarely attended school more than two days a week before Christmas, and the same happened in April and May. As a result, I struggled through elementary, middle, and high school.</p><p>In 1965, I graduated from Wolfe Project High School at the age of 19.</p><p>Education</p><p>In September 1965, I enrolled at AM&amp;N College. Because I was financially deprived, the only way I could attend college was through the National Defense Student Loan and by participating in work study.</p><p>In 1969, I completed the requirements for graduation and earned a B.S. degree in Math Education.</p><p>I went on to pursue additional studies, earning:</p><p>A Master’s degree in Education Administration from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.</p><p>A Doctorate degree in D.Min and Pastoral Ministry from St. Martin College and Seminary, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>Career in Education</p><p>After graduating in 1969, I was hired as the bookstore manager at AM&amp;N College, a position I held until 1975.</p><p>I then became a math teacher at Southeast Middle School in the Pine Bluff School District. In addition to teaching, I also served as a bus driver for the district. Later, I advanced to become assistant principal and then principal at the same school.</p><p>Though I retired, I was later rehired as interim superintendent for the district, followed by serving as principal of Pine Bluff High School. I officially retired from the district in 2012.</p><p>Ministry</p><p>I accepted the call to ministry and in February 1977, I became pastor of Mt. Harmony Missionary Baptist Church. I have faithfully served as pastor of this church for over 37 years.</p><p>Through ministry, I have taught, preached, and evangelized in churches across America, as well as in parts of Europe and Africa.</p><p>Service and Leadership</p><p>I served 15 years on the Arkansas State Claims Commission.</p><p>In addition, I have held leadership roles including:</p><p>President of the District Congress</p><p>Moderator of the District Association</p><p>President of the Arkansas Congress of Christian Education</p><p>Family</p><p>I am married to Carrie L. Rayford, and together we have three children: Thaddeus, Leslie, and Cassandra.</p><p>We are also blessed with five grandchildren: Thaddeus Jr., Raven, Kimarra, Carrington Mills, and Barry Joe Minor.</p><p>Faith and Legacy</p><p>From education to ministry, my life has been centered on service, leadership, and faith. To God be the Glory.</p></section>
