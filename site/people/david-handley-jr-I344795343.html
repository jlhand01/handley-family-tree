        <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>David Handley Sr</p><p>Life Story of David Handley, Jr.</p><p>Early Life</p><p>The story begins in a rural country store in Tillar, Arkansas, around 1945. David Handley, Sr. and his young son, David Handley, Jr., then about eight years old, went in to buy supplies.</p><p>Feeling tired, David Jr. sat down in a chair. An irate white man told him, “Boy, get out of that chair,” and began kicking at him. David Jr. replied, “When I grow up, I am going to kill you for doing that.”</p><p>Terrified, Mr. Handley, Sr. told his son, “Boy, that chair is for white folks.” The storeowner added, “You need to take that boy home and give him a whipping.” Mr. Handley, Sr. quickly left the store with his son.</p><p>At home, he gave David Jr. a whipping—not because he believed his son deserved it, but because he wanted to protect his life and help him understand the harsh realities of the South at that time.</p><p>Character and Convictions</p><p>From that moment forward, David Jr. became known as an outspoken, strong man who always spoke his mind and stood up for what he believed. Now 77 years old, he has endured discrimination in many areas of life—through his service in the U.S. Marines, in his career, and in social interactions.</p><p>Despite these challenges, he has always fought for justice while remaining a peaceful man.</p><p>Family Life</p><p>David has raised four sons, has been married to his wife, Rosa, for 45 years, and is the proud grandfather of three. He has always shared a strong bond with his family and continues to instill in them sound principles of life and the importance of fighting for what is right.</p><p>Faith Journey</p><p>David joined New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in 1955 and remained a member until 1980, when he moved his membership to Mt. Nebo Missionary Baptist Church in Wilmington, North Carolina.</p><p>Education</p><p>David attended Arkansas AM&amp;N (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) from 1957 to 1958, majoring in Political Science. His plan was to fund his college education through military service in the Marines and then leave. Instead, he continued serving for 15 years, retiring in 1973.</p><p>Military Service</p><p>David Handley, Jr. survived countless skirmishes behind enemy lines during three tours in Vietnam. He was a paratrooper and parachute jump master at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.</p><p>His distinguished service in the U.S. Marines is a lasting testament to his courage, perseverance, and dedication to his country.</p><p>Career</p><p>Following his military retirement, David worked at International Paper for more than 20 years before retiring in 1996. For a short while, he also managed the New Hanover County farm.</p><p>Later Years</p><p>Though now facing multiple health issues, David continues to enjoy life. Each day, he thanks God for the blessings of family, faith, and the strength to persevere.</p></section>
