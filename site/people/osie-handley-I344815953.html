        <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>Osie Handley</p><p>Life Story of Osie Handley</p><p>Born April 12, 1951</p><p>Early Life</p><p>I was born on April 12, 1951, in Tillar, Arkansas, delivered by a midwife named Sweet Ola James. At birth, I weighed 12 pounds, the heaviest of all sixteen children, which earned me the nickname “Fat Boy.”</p><p>As a child, I often had to stay home to work in the fields. This responsibility caused me to fall two grades behind in school.</p><p>Education</p><p>When our daddy moved us to Pine Bluff, I was 16 years old. I attended C.P. Coleman High School and graduated in 1972.</p><p>Although I was two grades behind, by the time I reached the 12th grade, I only needed one credit in order to graduate. This allowed me to begin taking college courses at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) that same year.</p><p>I was also able to take classes with my older brother, David, since we were both in the Political Science program. David had returned from serving in the Marines, which made this possible.</p><p>I completed my courses at UAPB in 1976.</p><p>Career</p><p>After college, I worked at the Department of Corrections for about a year, teaching in my field. However, I soon discovered that teaching was not my calling.</p><p>I later began working at Central Maloney, where we manufactured transformers.</p><p>In 2000, I moved to West Memphis, Arkansas, and began working at a chemical plant called CIBA.</p><p>Health and Recovery</p><p>After six months at CIBA, I became seriously ill and was unable to work for nearly two years due to pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Through God’s grace and mercy, I made a full recovery. Today, I thank God daily for keeping me and restoring my health.</p></section>
