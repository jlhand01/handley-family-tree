                <section class='person-biography'><h2>Biography</h2><p>Darryl Handley</p><p>Life Story of Darryl Handley</p><p>Early Memories</p><p>I remember my brothers telling me stories about being in Tillar and not being big enough to pick cotton. Since I was too small, I had to sit on the back of the cotton sack and watch while my older brothers picked cotton.</p><p>Education</p><p>In 1966, I moved to Pine Bluff and enrolled in Coleman Elementary School for the second grade. My teacher was Mrs. Mallette, and I thought she was so mean at the time.</p><p>Between the ages of seven and ten, when school was out, our dad required us to write multiplication numbers daily—starting from 1 through 12 in the first month and moving up to 16 as the summer went on.</p><p>Faith and Church Life</p><p>I remember going to church every Sunday without a choice. Dad was a deacon at Union Hopewell, and through his influence, I became the secretary of the Sunday School, a position I held for three years.</p><p>A few summers later, BTU started, and while everyone else enjoyed free time, I had to attend every summer. At the time, I didn’t understand why, but now I do—because I am a deacon myself today.</p><p>Family Influence</p><p>My mother was unlike anyone else—soft, loving, and always giving. Dad was firm and disciplined. If I ever needed anything, I could always ask Mom. If she didn’t have it, she would call some of her sons who were doing well, and they would provide whatever was needed.</p><p>Blessings</p><p>My greatest gifts of all are my two precious daughters: Candice L. Handley and Jazmine D. Handley.</p><p>I thank God for my parents, who gave me faith and guidance. I also thank Him for my siblings—Dollie, “Mott,” and “Sis”—who have been God’s continuing blessings in my life.</p></section>
